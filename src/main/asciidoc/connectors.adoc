[[connectors]]
== The Connectors.
These are the modules that interact with the endpoints. They come in the following flavors:

Bedework:: interacts with the bedework system using CalWS-Soap.

Campus Groups:: Accepts data generated by Campus Groups. This is read-only.

File:: Reads a remote file. Currently only ics is supported. Uses etags to try to avoid reads when possible.

OrgSync:: Was used for OrgSync

Exchange:: No longer supported and removed. The code was removed June 30th, 2025. If there were sufficient interest, it could possibly be reinstated.

Manager:: A special connector for management operations.
